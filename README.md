# 2024 Election Project

This is the code and presentation for my capstone project with Digital Futures, focusing on the 2024 UK General Election.

The project aimed to compare predictions made for the election, and to produce some predictions of my own, which turned out to be quite accurate compared to the final results

The presentation was given the morning of the 5th of July 2024, when some constituencies were still yet to declare, and before full results were easily available, so full comparison against the final result is a work in progress now that I have completed the academy training.

The geopackage file used to make the maps in the presentation is unfortunately too large to upload to GitHub, so some functionality is not present in this version.

The following files may be of interest:

 ### model_comparison.ipynb

 Takes in the predictions from various sources and produces a series of graphs, maps and charts to display the differences between those models.

 ### constituency_preview.ipynb

 Shows a map of the selected constituency as well as bar graphs showing the predictions made by different pollsters. Note that the maps cannot be produced without the geopackage data

 ### Strong Transition Model.ipynb

Using the strong transition model to produce an initial prediction for the election

### Election '24 in Data.pptx

The final presentation of the data.
